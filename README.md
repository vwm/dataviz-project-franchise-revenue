# dataviz-project-proposal
This is a rough draft of a data visualization project proposal.

## Data
I propose to visualize [franchise revenue data](https://gist.github.com/vwm/1598b47bed8c5ecdd18dea2fb52680f4/#file-readme-md) for my project.  The dataset originates from R for Data Science's Tidy Tuesday weekly event for [July 2, 2019](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-07-02).

This data shows the revenue of franchises by their media category (e.g., video games, merchandise, etc.), the original media source (e.g., book, film, etc.), the year the franchise was created, the franchise creator, and the current owner.

## Prototypes
...

## Questions & Tasks
These initial questions are a guideline for the visualization's development path, and they may serve as implementation ideas.
* How does revenue by revenue category change over time?
* How does the age of a franchise correlate with its total revenue?
* Is there a correlation between the original media type and the relative success of a franchise?

## Sketches

## Open Questions
I'm considering several questions as the visualization takes shape.
* How can the user make informed dynamic choices on how to slice the visualization?
* How should the visualization take outliers into account for readability and visibility purposes?
* How will the visualization be managed to make it look polished (e.g., no truncated labels, properly formatted text and labels, etc.).
* How will the visualization simultaneously support and show different summaries of data (e.g., revenue by franchise category vs. total revenue by franchise).
